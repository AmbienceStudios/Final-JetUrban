   <p className='p-long'>

   My mother was killed when I was just 5 years old. Her name was (T)amaura (E)laine (J)ohnson. 
   <br/> <br/> I wanted her name to live on through me, so I created a luxury urban clothing 
   brand by the name of JET URBAN CLOTHING.


<br/><br/>


Urban was added in because I wanted to be a voice for the low income urban areas. 
A lot of us are victims to a centralized system that was meant to oppress & control.    </p>

<h2>NO MORE!!!!</h2>

   <div className="columnA-right"><h1>WHY POLYGON?
  </h1>
   
   <p className='p-long'>

   ​ After comparing different blockchains, Its been decided to go with the Polygon.
    It won the top spot because of its a representation of us, which is scalability,
     originality, its innovation in this space.Also, to offer affordability to our holders 
     on gas fees & because of the flexibility around Golangs programming language. <br/> <br/>



 Each 1 of 1 is Edited with traits ranging from Tattoos,
 shades, hats, shoes & more. All warriors are Rare, but some are rarer than others.
  Each warrior is standing firm on the polygon magic network.
